Neural networks with persistent memory

Just a for-fun side project. I attempted to rebuild one of my current projects in the Bend programming language, which seems really cool and powerful. Unfortunately Bend's compiler is limited to 32 bit architecture currently, so it can't create programs with access to more than 4gigs of memory. If/when they manage to upgrade hvm to 64 bit, though, I'll be jumping on this bandwagon for sure!
